Option, Description
db_src, A `dbplyr`-compatible database connection that is the default  target for all database operations 
cdm_schema, The name of the database schema in which CDM clinical data resides.
vocabulary_schema,The name of the database schema in which CDM vocabulary tables reside.  This is intended primarily for OMOP-like CDMs that normalize out concept names.
default_results_schema, The name (or `NA` for none) of a schema into which to write results by default
default_retain_intermediates,A Boolean value indicating whether default behavior of `argos` should be to treat intermediate codeset and results tables as temporary (`FALSE`) or permanent (`TRUE`).
table_names,"A list used to map  names used in calls to `cdm_tbl()` to actual table names in the database.  The function searches for a list element whose name is the value in the fumction call, and substitutes in the corresponding list element as a character string.  This is intended primarily to account for split tables or common prefix or suffix for table names in the database. "
base_dir,"The root of the directory tree containing files for the current session. This is primarily useful because methods will use relative paths to support files by default (e.g. project code in 'code', codesets in 'specs')."
extra_packages,A vector of package names that the `setup()` method should ensure are loaded before running any analytic code.
site_info,"The path to an R source file containing site-level definitions that may cross sessions or invocations, such as database locations or table name mappings."
retain_intermediates,A Boolean value indicating whether `argos` should overrise the default configuration in this session and treat intermediate codeset and results tables as temporary (`FALSE`) or permanent (`TRUE`).  If this is `NA` the default setting is used.
results_schema,"The name of a schema into which to write results.  If it is `NA`, the default setting is used."
results_name_tag,"A character string to be appended to the names of any results or intermediate tables (often a project or ticket number), or none if `NA`.  It is best kept short, given limits on the length of table names in some databases."
local_name_tag,"A character string to be appended to the names of results tables designated 'local' in `output_tbl()`, in addition to `results_name_tag`.  The same considerations aply."
execution_mode,"A switch controlling some behaviors when an analysis is started via `setup()`.  If the value is 'development', then files are sourced but `run_request()` is not called, allowing the user to continue interactively.  Results are written to the database by default.  If the value is 'production', then `run_request()` is called automatically, and results are written to the database.  If the value is 'distribution', then `run_request()` is called automatically and results are written to local CSV files by default."
results_target,"A switch controlling the default location to write results.  If the value is the character string 'file', results default to local CSV files.  For historical reasons, if the value is `TRUE`, results default to the database connection in `config('db_src')`.  Otherwise, the value should be a DBI data source, to which results will be written."
db_trace,"A Boolean value indicating whether informational messages for database queries should be shown.  If `TRUE`, each time a query is executed via `argos`, the generated SQL and if available an explain plan will be output."
cache_enabled,"A Boolean value indicating whether codesets and similar things should be cached when first loaded, and subsequent calls should return the cached value rather than reloading the codeset (which can be expensive).  It defaults to `FALSE` if the execution_mode is 'development', and `TRUE` otherwise."
