Description: Using databases following the OMOP Common Data Model or similar CDMs
  typically involves a fair amount of common and repeated tasks.  This package
  collects conventions, best practices, and affordances developed at PEDSnet
  [https://pedsnet.org] to make interacting with this type of data easier and
  more reproducible.
